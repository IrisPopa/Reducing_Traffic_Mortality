# Reducing_Traffic_Mortality

## Project Task
The US Department of Transportation has requested our assistance in investigating how to reduce the frequency of road accidents nationwide. 
In order to accomplish this task, we have examined the demographics of traffic accident victims in each US state and found substantial variations among them. 
Our objective is to identify any underlying patterns in these variations so that we can develop a comprehensive policy action plan that includes 
recommendations on how to effectively address this issue.
To accomplish these tasks, I used data manipulation, plotting, dimensionality reduction, and unsupervised clustering.

## Datasets
The datasets was originally collected by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the National Association of Insurance Commissioners.

**road-accidents.csv** containes the following 5 features: 
<p>state - the state name;

<p>perc_fatl_speed - Percentage Of Drivers Involved In Fatal Collisions Who Were Speeding (2009);
<p>perc_fatl_alcohol - Percentage Of Drivers Involved In Fatal Collisions Who Were Alcohol-Impaired (2011);
<p>perc_fatl_1st_time - Percentage Of Drivers Involved In Fatal Collisions Who Had Not Been Involved In Any Previous Accidents (2011.

**miles-driven.csv** containes the following 2 features:
